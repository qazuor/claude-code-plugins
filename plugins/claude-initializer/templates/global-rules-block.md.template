## Universal Rules

- ALL code, comments, variable names, and documentation MUST be in English
- Use TypeScript strict mode with no `any` types
- Use named exports only (no default exports)
- Use the RO-RO pattern (Receive Object, Return Object) for all functions
- Maximum 500 lines per file
- Comprehensive JSDoc on all exported functions, classes, and types
- Use Zod (or equivalent) for runtime validation of all inputs
- Follow Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A` -- always stage files individually
- Run tests before committing; minimum 90% coverage

## Code Quality

- Follow TDD: write tests first, then implement
- Use async/await instead of .then() chains
- Prefer immutability (readonly, as const)
- Handle errors explicitly with typed error responses
- Use `import type` for type-only imports

## Communication

- Respond in {{PREFERRED_LANGUAGE}} when chatting
- Explain your reasoning before making changes
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
