## Best Practices

### Do's

- **Be Conversational**: Write like you're talking to a person, not a corporate
  entity
- **Lead with Benefits**: Focus on what the user gains, not just features
- **Use Active Voice**: "Start your free trial" vs "A free trial can be started"
- **Be Specific**: "Save up to 20%" vs "Save money"
- **Create Urgency**: "Limited spots available" (only when true)
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Use concrete examples and real scenarios
- **Write for Scanning**: Use short paragraphs, bullet points, subheadings
- **Test with Real Users**: Get feedback from actual target audience when possible
- **Use Inclusive Language**: Avoid gendered, ableist, or exclusionary terms
- **Proofread Thoroughly**: Typos destroy trust instantly

### Don'ts

- **No Jargon**: Avoid technical terms unless necessary (then explain them)
- **No Passive Voice**: Unless specific context requires it
- **No Vague Claims**: "World-class service" without evidence is meaningless
- **No Keyword Stuffing**: SEO at the expense of readability defeats the purpose
- **No Literal Translation**: Transcreate for cultural relevance when localizing
- **No Wall of Text**: Break up long paragraphs into digestible chunks
- **No Clickbait**: Don't make promises you can't keep
- **No Corporate Speak**: Avoid "synergy", "leverage", "paradigm", etc.
- **No ALL CAPS**: Unless strategically for single-word emphasis
- **No Mixed Tone**: Maintain consistent formality level within a page

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Benefit-Driven Headlines

**When to use:** Landing pages, product descriptions, marketing materials

**Formula:** [Action Verb] + [Desired Outcome] + [Context/Qualifier]

**Examples:**

- "Build Your Dream Project in Minutes"
- "Save Hours on Repetitive Tasks"
- "Connect with Your Customers Like Never Before"

### Pattern 2: Social Proof Integration

**When to use:** Building trust, overcoming objections

**Elements:**

- Testimonials with names and context
- Statistics (users, items, reviews)
- Trust badges (verified, secure, guarantee)

**Example:**

```markdown
> "This changed how our team works. We went from hours of manual work to
> minutes." -- Alex R., Product Manager

4.9/5 from 1,200+ verified users
```

### Pattern 3: Urgency Without Pressure

**When to use:** Encouraging action, but only when factually true

**Acceptable:**

- "Only 3 spots left at this price"
- "12 people are viewing this right now"
- "Offer ends January 31st"

**Unacceptable:**

- False scarcity tactics
- Fake countdown timers
- Misleading claims

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Content Sounds Too Formal

**Symptoms:** Stiff language, passive voice, corporate jargon
**Cause:** Trying too hard to sound "professional"
**Solution:**

- Read content aloud -- does it sound like a human talking?
- Replace passive voice with active
- Replace jargon with simple words
- Add contractions (you're vs you are)
- Use "you" and "your" frequently

### Issue: Translation Sounds Awkward

**Symptoms:** Localized version feels forced or unnatural
**Cause:** Literal word-for-word translation
**Solution:**

- Transcreate, don't translate -- convey meaning, not words
- Use idiomatic expressions from the target locale
- Check verb forms and formality level for the region
- Have a native speaker review
- Consider cultural context and references

### Issue: SEO vs Readability Conflict

**Symptoms:** Keywords feel forced, content is awkward
**Cause:** Over-optimization for search engines
**Solution:**

- Prioritize human readers first, always
- Use keywords naturally in context
- Use synonyms and semantic variations
- Focus on topic coverage, not keyword density
- Consult with SEO specialist for guidance

### Issue: Inconsistent Tone Across Pages

**Symptoms:** Different pages feel like they were written by different people
**Cause:** No established voice guidelines or glossary
**Solution:**

- Create a brand voice guidelines document
- Build a terminology glossary
- Define tone variations for different contexts
- Review all content against the guidelines
- Create templates for common content types

---

## Success Metrics

- **Conversion Rate**: Increase in desired actions from improved copy
- **Engagement**: Time on page, scroll depth, CTA click-through rates
- **Readability**: Flesch Reading Ease consistently in target range
- **SEO Performance**: Improved rankings for target keywords
- **Voice Consistency**: Positive results in content audits
- **Translation Quality**: Native speaker approval ratings
- **Error Reduction**: Fewer support tickets due to unclear messaging
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on clarity and helpfulness

---

## Notes

- **Tone Calibration**: The balance between friendly and professional shifts by
  context (marketing = more friendly, legal = more formal, errors = empathetic
  and clear)
- **Content Updates**: Regularly refresh content to maintain freshness and SEO
  relevance
- **A/B Testing**: When possible, test different copy variations to optimize
  conversion rates
- **Accessibility**: Always write with inclusive language and consider screen
  reader compatibility
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Be aware of cultural differences when creating
  content for diverse audiences
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure promotional content complies with relevant
  advertising regulations
- **Data Privacy**: Never include personal data in example content or templates

---

**Remember:** Great content is invisible -- users should focus on the message
and the action, not notice the writing. Write to serve the user first, the
brand second, and search engines third. When in doubt, choose clarity over
cleverness.
