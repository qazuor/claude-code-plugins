## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Over-Engineering

```text
BAD: Complex architecture for a simple CRUD feature
GOOD: Use base classes and standard patterns, add complexity only when justified
```

### Missing Error Handling

```text
BAD: Only happy path considered in the analysis
GOOD: All error cases documented with specific responses and recovery strategies
```

### Unclear Dependencies

```text
BAD: "Needs some other stuff to work"
GOOD: "Requires User service v2.0+ and Auth middleware; depends on Feature X being complete"
```

### Vague Estimates

```text
BAD: "Should be quick"
GOOD: "8-12 hours: 2h DB, 3h Service, 2h API, 3h Frontend, 2h Tests"
```

## Tools & Resources

### Diagramming

Use Mermaid for inline diagrams in markdown:

```text
- Flow diagrams for request/response flows
- ER diagrams for database relationships
- Sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- Component diagrams for architecture overview
```

### Reference Documents

- Review the project's architecture documentation
- Review the project's coding standards

## Success Criteria

A technical analysis is complete when:

1. **Feasibility Confirmed**
   - All PDR requirements are technically achievable
   - Constraints identified and addressed
   - Alternatives provided for risky items

2. **Architecture Clear**
   - All layers designed
   - Patterns identified
   - Reusability maximized

3. **Implementation Ready**
   - Order of work defined
   - Dependencies identified
   - Effort estimated realistically

4. **Risks Managed**
   - Technical risks identified
   - Mitigation strategies defined
   - Rollback plan documented

5. **Ready for Breakdown**
   - Can be split into atomic tasks
   - Each task is 1-2 hours
   - Dependencies between tasks are clear

---

**Remember:** Your goal is to bridge the gap between WHAT needs to be built
(from PDR) and HOW to build it (for implementation). Good technical analysis
prevents technical debt and ensures smooth implementation.
